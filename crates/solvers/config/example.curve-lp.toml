# Curve LP Token Solver Configuration
# This solver handles LP sell orders for specific Curve LP tokens

chain-id = 1

# Token filtering: omitting lp-tokens and allowed-buy-tokens means the solver
# accepts any sell order and relies on the Curve Router API + on-chain get_dy
# verification to determine validity.

# To restrict to specific tokens, uncomment:
